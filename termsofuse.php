        <div class="panel-body">
        	<p>These Terms of Use will apply to the use of the Service. 
            Please read these Terms of Use carefully so that you know what your 
            rights and obligations are when using the Service. The acceptance of 
            these Terms of Use constitutes a valid and binding agreement between 
            LGBT Students and you for the use of the Service. If you make any use of 
            the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. The terms,
             indicated with a capital, whether single or plural, will have the meaning 
             as stated in '15. Definitions' of these Terms of Use.
            </p>
            
        <ol>
         	<li><strong>Scope</strong></li>
            	<ol>
                	<li>The Terms of Use apply to the Agreement and all use that Users make of the Service.</li>
                	<li>
                    LGBT may amend these Terms of Use at any time. The User will be 
                    individually notified of any amendments by email and/or private message 
                    and/or upon logging in to the Service. If the User continues to use the 
                    Service after these Terms of Use have been amended or supplemented, the 
                    User thereby irrevocably accepts the amended or supplemented Terms of Use. 
                    If the User does not agree with the amended or supplemented Terms of Use, 
                    the User's exclusive remedy is to no longer use the Service and to ban his 
                    Account.

                    <li>
                    If any provision in these Terms of Use shall be held to be (partly) 
                    void or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will 
                    remain in full force and effect. In such a case, LGBT will replace the 
                    void or unenforceable provisions with new ones. In doing so, the purpose 
                    and meaning of the void or unenforceable provisions will be taken into 
                    account as far as possible.

                    In the event of a dispute between the Parties concerning the 
                    explanation of a legal term, the Dutch explanation of this term will prevail.

                    The User acknowledges and agrees that LGBT does not pre-screen User 
                    Content posted or transmitted by means of the Service and that LGBT  has no 
                    influence over the User Content provided by means of the Service. LGBT is 
                    not liable and/or responsible for the User Content provided by means of the 
                    Service and/or any use made of the Service by Users.

                    <li>
                    LGBT shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole 
                    discretion, to review, edit, limit or refuse User Content posted or 
                    transmitted by means of the Service and/or to limit and/or refuse a User 
                    access and/or use of the Service, more specifically in the event that the 
                    User has been banned from the Service earlier. LGBT  will furthermore have
                     the right to remove any User Content that, according to LGBT, violates these 
                     Terms of Use and/or that it deems to be otherwise objectionable. LGBT may 
                     disclose your Personal Data and/or User Content to third parties where it 
                     believes, in good faith, that it is necessary to comply with a court order, 
                     ongoing judicial proceeding, criminal or civil subpoena, or other legal 
                     process or request by law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, or to 
                     exercise its legal rights of defense against legal claims.

                    In order to be able to use the Service optimally, the User has to create an
                     Account in the way as described on the Website and/or App. By means 
                     of the Account, the User can amend, update and/or delete his Profile. The 
                     User is responsible for keeping his Credentials confidential. The User is 
                     responsible and liable for all use made of the Service by means of his 
                     Account. As soon as the User knows or has reason to assume that his Account 
                     has come into the hands of unauthorized persons, the User should inform 
                     LGBT Community of this, notwithstanding his own obligations to take 
                     immediate effective measures himself, such as changing the password of his 
                     Account.

                    The User may register his own user Account, as described on the Website. 
                    The User may only register a user Account if he is a natural person and 
                    only on his own behalf.

                    PLANETROMEO may, at its sole discretion, request a User to provide additional 
                    information to verify Personal Data and/or User Content that the User has 
                    posted on his Account and/or the Service. Based on this additional 
                    information, LGBT  may decide to edit or delete Personal Data and/or User 
                    Content and/or to ban or unban the Account and the User's use of the Service.
